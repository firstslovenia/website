> **“Vsak otrok je umetnik, težava leži v tem kako ostati umetnik, ko odrasteš.”** <br />
-Pablo Picasso

Tako bi na kratko opisali izziv “Let Those Words Flow”. Tokrat smo bili primorani se podati
v bolj poetične vode. S skupnimi močmi smo uspešno privijačili tudi kar nekaj lepo zvenečih
povedi. Lepo vas vabimo, da jih preberete ob kakšni jutranji kavici ali pa večernem čokoladnem mleku.

Be a surgeon, a witch doctor or a nurse,<br />
it’s beautiful that the world is diverse.<br />
Diverse like nature, but we must say no to theft,<br />
because aligator boots and a snake purse,<br />
shouldn’t be the only thing that is left.<br />

Be a scientist, magician or chemical witch,<br />
numbers and formulas are forbidden to ditch.<br />
What is equal, is not less,<br />
there is no shame in saying “God bless”.<br />

Be a poet, superhero or cook,<br />
doing something good proves you’re not a crook.<br />
Saving the hungry, gifting the bored,<br />
soon you’ll be the one everyone adored.<br />

Be an athlete, dreamer or actor,<br />
but never forget what you act for.<br />
Once upon a time we were thankful to Santa,<br />
today we thank the fighters for rights, environmental fights,<br />
remember, always keep your goals in you sights.<br />

Isn’t it strange,<br />
how quickly can one make a change?<br />

No matter if you’re wealthy,<br />
smart,silly or looking for spare change,<br />
you mind is healthy,<br />
so do engage!<br />

Engage into Science,<br />
for a new world of defiance.<br />
Engage into Technology,<br />
since it is far from mithology.<br />
Engage into Engineering,<br />
because it is mathematically appealing.<br />
What about Math?<br />
Do not worry,<br />
everywhere around you,<br />
you can witness its numerical wrath.<br />
<br />
-Nail Kuduzović

What is your dream?<br />
What do you want to do?<br />
Do you feel like relaxing?<br />
Tightening a screw?<br />
Well, then STEM is for you.<br />

A world full of numerical wonders,<br />
robotical fantasies and wonderfull groups.<br />
What are you waiting for?<br />
Gather you engineering troops!<br />

Some wheels, tires and a good song,<br />
a simple recipe,<br />
for the best summer to last long.<br />

Do it for all, the waters, trees,<br />
birds and bees, until you realize,<br />
what STEM really means.<br />
<br />
-Matej Šajn

If only I knew, if only I found out,<br />
what is there to know,<br />
what is it about?<br />

Race your thoughts, every doubt,<br />
find yourself,<br />
don’t be affraid to shout.<br />

Grap a screw, engine, some tape and glue,<br />
crafting is fun, like three, one, two.<br />

Some numbers, equations, letters and dice,<br />
we too can construct something extremely nice.<br />

Give nature a present, gift if the act of recycling,<br />
spreading awareness, saving the waters, the trees,<br />
they will be thankful, don’t forget about bees.<br />
<br />
