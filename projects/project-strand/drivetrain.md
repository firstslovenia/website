# Mecanum drivetrain

This is a four wheel mecanum drive based drivetrain, compatible with the REV Robotics and goBILDA build systems. <br />
It already includes many different configurable presets, but those who wish to do so can also modify their copy of the CAD document to their liking. <br />
<br />
There are two different versions of the drivetrain currently in development:
- one you can laser cut and hand cut parts for<br />
	it can be found [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/4e65c7e93fb9b9d70e47d504/w/bd88bb0fb1144ac90c8e0fea/e/b6aa0f24d8907cb64c8843fa)
- and another you can CNC<br />
	*we'll release it once it is done*
